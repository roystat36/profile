                <h3>Influence of Social Factors on Perceptions of Climate Knowledge: A Case Study of
                    Khulna City Corporation, Bangladesh</h3>
                <p><strong>August, 2022 - January, 2023</strong></p>
                Climate change has emerged as a critical global issue, necessitating concerted efforts from 
                policymakers to establish climate justice and foster green development. Bangladesh, 
                positioned in the global south, stands as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate 
                change impacts. Understanding community perceptions and knowledge regarding climate-related 
                issues is essential for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. However , 
                comprehensive studies addressing these aspects are yet lacking from this country. 
                This study, therefore, focuses on Khulna City Corporation in Bangladesh, one of the worst 
                victims of climate change impacts, to assess the populace's level of basic climate change 
                knowledge and their awareness of initiatives undertaken by stakeholders. Furthermore, it 
                examines how social factors such as gender, age, religion, profession, and location shape 
                individuals' perceptions of climate change. The study also explores how governmental 
                organizations (GOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international non-governmental
                organizations (INGOs) could utilize this information to achieve climate justice in 
                Bangladesh. This study shows that many residents in the Khulna City Corporation lack basic
                understanding of climate change causes and solutions. Additionally, they are not concerned
                with any activities taken by different groups to address this issue.

                <h3>The causes and Consequences of Road Accident in Bangladesh</h3>
                <p><strong>April, 2022 - January, 2023</strong></p>
                One of Bangladesh’s biggest issues right now is road accidents. It is the cause of many 
                fatalities and injuries that negatively impact human life. The main objective of this 
                research is to identify the reasons behind the increasing road accidents in Bangladesh. 
                In this research, data on road accidents for the years 2006 to 2020 in Bangladesh were 
                collected by reading daily newspapers. The technique of generalized linear models (GLMs) 
                were used in this study. Because of the Poisson regression model’s overdispersion, a 
                Negative Binomial regression model was applied for the purpose of the best-suited model. 
                This study has found that the number of road accidents in Bangladesh was increasing and 
                that the majority of them occurred during the winter and rainy seasons. A driver’s careless 
                driving of the vehicle accounts for 62.117% of all road accident causes, whereas loss of 
                control of the vehicle was responsible for 20.82% of all accidents. It was found in this 
                study that the majority of accidents took place in divisional and highly populated cities, 
                with Dhaka having the highest frequency. On the basis of correlation and regression analysis, 
                it was determined that population growth is the root cause of road accidents. Population 
                growth could explain the 31.42% variation in the number of road accidents. The causes of 
                road accidents were found to have a to have a significant effect on road accidents on the
                basis of the Poisson regression model. As there exists overdispersion in the Poisson 
                regression model, a Negative Binomial regression model has been found to be the best-suited
                technique for modeling causes of road accidents.
