            <div class="education-details">
                I have developed a Probability Calculation app designed for users who may not have access to 
                statistical software. This app allows users to easily calculate probability values using various 
                distributions, simplifying the process of understanding and applying statistical concepts. It provides 
                an intuitive interface to help users make informed decisions based on probability analysis.

            <h2>Central Limit Theorem</h2>
            <div class="education-details">
                The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most popular theorems in statistics. It states that as 
                the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal 
                distribution, regardless of the population's shape. This theorem is foundational for inferential
                statistics, supporting hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. I have developed a Shiny app
                using this concept, enabling users to easily understand how the distribution behaves with large 
                samples. To see the app, <a href="https://roystat67.shinyapps.io/CLTapps/">click here</a>.

            <h2>Law of Large Number</h2>
            <div class="education-details">
                The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental theorem in statistics. It states that as the sample 
                size grows, the sample mean will converge to the population mean, regardless of initial 
                variations. This principle is essential for probability theory and ensures reliable estimates 
                in repeated trials. I have developed a Shiny app based on this concept, allowing users to 
                observe how the sample mean approaches the population mean as the number of trials increases.
